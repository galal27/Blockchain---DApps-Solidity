\f0\fs24 \cf0 Auction for Fundraising for a Social Cause\
\
Problem Statement:\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs22 \cf0 Consider the problem of Chinese auction or penny social. It is a conventional approach used for fundraising for a cause. The organizers collect items to be auctioned off for raising funds. Before the auction, the items for auctions are received and arranged each with a bowl to place the bid. A chairperson is a special person among the organizers. She/he heads the effort and is the only person who can determine the winner by random drawing at the end of the auction. A set of bidders buy sheets of tickets with their money. The bidder\'92s sheet has a stub that identifies the bidder\'92s number, and tokens bought. \
The bidders examine the items to bid, place the one or more tickets in the bowl in front of the items they desire to bid for until all the tickets are used. After the auction period ends the chairperson, collects the bowls, randomly selects a ticket from each item\'92s bowl to determine the winning bidder for that item. The item is transferred to the winning bidder. Total money collected is the fund raised by the penny social auction. \

Assumptions:\

\fs22 The description given above is for a general penny social auction. For the sake of our project implementation we will introduce some simplifying assumptions. Here they are: \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa40\partightenfactor0
\cf0 1. Fixed number of bidders, initialized to 4. All 4 need to self-register. Funds transfer from bidder is automatically done and is not in the scope of this application. \
2. Fixed number of items to be auctioned off, initialized to 3. \
3. Items auctioned are indexed from 0..N-1 where N is the number of items for auction. N is 2. \
4. Each bidder buys just 1 sheet of tickets or tokens; each sheet has only 5 tokens. \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 5. Assume simple number for the serial numbers for the sheet of tickets: 0,1,2,3. Here we show the tokens of bidder 0 and 1. \
